# Computer Vision Fundamentals

This repository contains my coursework projects implementing fundamental computer vision techniques in Python:
- RGB â†’ Grayscale conversion and per-channel histograms  
- Gaussian noise addition and filtering  
- Edge detection (Sobel, Laplacian)  
- A custom implementation of the Canny edge detector  

See `report.pdf` for method descriptions, results, and reflections. Code is in the `Codes/` folder and figures are in `results/`.
